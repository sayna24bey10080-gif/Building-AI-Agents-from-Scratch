# =============================================================
# HANDS-ON 8 — MCP Prompts
# =============================================================
#
# WHAT THIS TEACHES:
#   - @mcp.prompt() — the THIRD MCP primitive (after Tools, Resources)
#   - Prompts are reusable instruction templates the server provides
#   - How prompts differ from tools and resources
#
# THE 3 MCP PRIMITIVES, SIDE BY SIDE:
#
#   Tool      -> AI PERFORMS an action       (claim_status(), get_policy())
#   Resource  -> AI READS data               (policy://all, customer summary)
#   Prompt    -> AI gets a SUGGESTED WORKFLOW (how to approach a task)
#
# Think of a Prompt as a pre-written "recipe" the server hands
# to the AI for a specific kind of task — like a template a
# senior employee gives a new hire: "here's how we review claims."
#
# THIS IS A REAL, RUNNABLE MCP SERVER.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   pip install mcp
#
# HOW TO RUN:
#   python insurance_server.py

# PROMPT 1: Claim Review Workflow

# @mcp.prompt() registers a reusable instruction template.
# When an AI client requests this prompt, it gets back text
# that guides HOW the AI should approach a task — not data,
# not an action, but a structured way of THINKING about a task.

    Review the claim details carefully and follow these steps:
 
    1. Verify the claim_id exists and pull its current status
    2. Check the policy is active and covers the claimed incident
    3. Identify any fraud indicators:
       - Unusually high claim amount vs policy history
       - Claim filed very soon after policy purchase
       - Multiple claims from the same customer in a short period
    4. Summarise your findings in plain language
    5. Recommend: Approve / Investigate Further / Reject

    When responding to insurance customers:
 
    1. Acknowledge their question warmly and clearly
    2. Provide the specific answer using available tools/resources
       (do not guess — always look up real claim/policy data)
    3. Explain any next steps in plain, non-technical language
    4. Avoid insurance jargon unless the customer used it first
    5. End with an offer to help further if needed

    1. State the policy type and policy ID clearly
    2. State the exact renewal/expiry date
    3. State the premium amount due
    4. Mention any late renewal penalties if applicable
    5. Provide a clear call to action (how to renew)
    Keep the tone friendly but create appropriate urgency if
    the renewal date is within 7 days.

# =============================================================
# CONCEPT CHECKPOINT:
#
#   Q: Tools, Resources, Prompts — summarise the difference
#      in one line each.
#   A: Tool     = AI DOES something (action with parameters)
#      Resource = AI READS something (data, mostly static)
#      Prompt   = AI is GUIDED on HOW to approach a task
#
#   Q: Could you achieve the same thing as a Prompt by just
#      writing good instructions in your AI agent's system message?
#   A: Yes, partially — but a Prompt lives on the SERVER, so any
#      MCP client connecting to this server automatically gets
#      access to the same well-tested workflow templates, instead
#      of every team reinventing their own instructions.
#
#   Q: When would you use a Prompt over hardcoding logic in
#      your AI agent's code?
#   A: When the "how to think about this task" should be owned
#      by the domain expert (e.g. insurance team) and reused
#      across multiple AI agents/clients consistently.
#
# CHALLENGE:
#   Add a 4th prompt: fraud_investigation_prompt() that gives a
#   step-by-step process specifically for HIGH-VALUE claims
#   (above Rs 50,000).
